 *	\brief Auxillary kernel to calculate wall temperature from ambient and column temperatures
 *	\details This file is responsible for calculating the wall temperature in a fixed-bed adsorber
 *			given the column temperature and ambient temperature or other temperature. It is linked
 *			with material properties to account for parameters of wall density, wall heat capacity,
 *			heat transfer coefficients, and column dimensions.
 *
 *			The calculation is carried out with a semi-implicit, first order linear approximation at
 *			the start and end of each time step.
